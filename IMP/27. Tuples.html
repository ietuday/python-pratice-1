<p>There's another datatype in Python called a <code>tuple</code> :</p>

<p><code>mytuple = (1, 2, "Three")</code> <br></p>









<p>It's exactly like a <code>list</code>  except:</p>











<p>1. You use round brackets instead of square brackets to define it.</p>











<p>2. A tuple is not mutable which means you can't append or remove items from tuples, unlike lists. Trying to do append to a tuple would throw an error:<br></p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&gt;&gt;&gt; mytuple = (1, 2, "Three") 
&gt;&gt;&gt; mytuple.append("Four")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'</pre>



















<p>Tuples are rarely used but if you ever want to have a sequence that you really don't want to be changed, then tuples might be a good idea to use.</p>
