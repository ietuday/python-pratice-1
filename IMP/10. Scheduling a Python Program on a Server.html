<p><strong>Scheduling a Python program on a 24/7 server</strong></p><p>Keeping your computer on 24 hours, 7 days a week, is not practical, so if you want to execute a Python script at a particular time every day, you probably need a computer that is on all the time. </p><p>PythonAnywhere gives you access to such a computer and you can upload a Python script there and schedule it to run at a certain time every day. This can be useful when you want for example to extract some values (e.g. weather data) from a website and generate a text file with the value or other reports every day. </p><p>To schedule Python script for execution on PythonAnywhere please follow the simple steps below:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up for a free account at https://www.pythonanywhere.com and then login.</p></li><li><p>Go to your Dashboard and then to Files and then to the Upload a File  button and upload the Python file you want to schedule for execution.</p></li><li><p>Go to Tasks and set the time (in UTC) of the day that you want your  script to be executed and type in the name of the Python file you  uploaded (e.g. myscript.py).</p></li><li><p>Click the Create button and you’re done.</p></li></ol><p>Your Python file will now be executed every day at the time given by  you. If you didn’t have a Python script and you’re still confused about  the benefit of this, here is a very simple Python script that you can  use to try the above steps:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">from datetime import datetime
with open(datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"), "w") as myfile:
myfile.write("Hi there!")</pre><p>The above code creates a text file and writes the string “Hi there!”  in that text file. The name of the text file will be the current date  and time. For example 2018-02-16-18-20-33.txt which is generated by  datetime.now indicating the date and time when the script was executed.  So every time the script is executed a new text file with a different  name is generated. You’re going to have a text file every day.</p>
