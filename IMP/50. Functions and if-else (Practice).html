<p>In one of the previous exercises we created the following function:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def string_length(mystring):
    return len(mystring)</pre>

















<p>Calling the function with a string as the value for the argument <code>mystring</code>  will return the length of that string. </p><p>However, if an integer is passed as an argument value:</p>









<p><code>string_length(10)</code> </p>



<p>that would generate an error since the <code>len()</code>  function doesn't work for integers.</p>







<p>Your duty is to modify the function so that if an integer is passed as an input, the function should output a message like "Sorry integers don't have length".</p>
