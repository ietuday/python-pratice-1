<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;In the next lecture we're going to use an enhanced Python interactive shell called IPython. IPython is just like the normal shell you get when you run <code>python</code>&nbsp;, but it provides better printing&nbsp;of large output. This makes IPython suitable for data analysis as it prints data in a well structured format. You can install IPython with pip:</p>

<p><code>pip install ipython</code>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>or</p>







<p><code>pip3 install ipython</code>&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>or</p>







<p><code>python3 -m pip install ipython</code>&nbsp;</p>
