'''
there are two types of errors
-syntax errors
-exceptions
python at first looks for syntax errors, then execute the code and looks for
exceptions
'''
#syntax error
#due the following sentences are methods, remember that m
#methods needs () to work properly
print(1)
int(9)
int 9
print(2)
print 3

'''

'''

a = 1
b="2"
print(int(2.5)
print(a+b)
'''
1st error
we will get the first error at line 22. the arrow will point at the print statement
but it all seems right with it. We have to look to the left to the arrow, and we will notice
that the previous print() has no a closing bracket
2nd error
we are trying to add 1 + "2". These are different type objects, string and int.
