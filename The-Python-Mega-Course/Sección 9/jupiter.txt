Jupyter is used on an explorer, to execute jupyter we open cmd on the
folder we want to work and we use the 'jupyter notebook' command to open
it.

to create a new python file we click on 'New' and then on 'Python 3'

Once we create a new python file, a new page will show up and we will be able
to work in it.

Every cell is like a block of code. we can write several lines of code in a cell

To create a new line on a cell we just press ENTER
To execute a cell we use CTRL+ENTER
To create a new cell we use ALT+ENTER
To delete a cell we use ESC+D+D
To go to the next cell we use SHIFT+ENTER. This will execute the current cell
and the will move to the next one.
