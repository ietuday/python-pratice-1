'''
lists=sequences of items
can store different data types.
some methods:
append(). inside parenthesis is the object we want to add at the end of the list
remove(). pass the value you want to remove

we can treat list almost the same as strings. we can access to objects by indexes
we can split a list, and some other things.


'''

myList = ["H", 2 , "Hello"]

'''
if we have something like this:
    print("Python is fun"[-3:][-1])
    the output will be: 'n'
why?
Because with the first slice, we take "fun" from the string, but then
we have another slice, that takes the last item ([-1]) from the previous substring.

in other words, we slice the sliced string.
