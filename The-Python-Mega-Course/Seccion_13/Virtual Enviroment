To create a python virtual enviroment we need the virtualenv library
pip install virtualenv

The virtual enviroment need to be created on the same folder that the one that
has the website files. (A sibling folder)

Then we created the virtual enviroment:
python -m venv virtual

once we have python, we have to install flask
virtual\Scripts\pip install flask

then, execute the webpage script
virtual\Scripts\python webpage\script1.py

Create virtual enviroment before creating a website
