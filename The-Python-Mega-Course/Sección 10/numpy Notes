To work with numpy we have to import the Numpy library
import Numpy

To create a array with a range we use the arange() method. Inside the
parenthesis we set the amount of numbers we want. This amount is n-1, because
it starts from zero

n = numpy.arage(27)

array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
       17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26])
That will be the output. Even though this may look like a list, is a
ndarray (n dimensional array) object

Once we have an array, we can re-dimension it by using the reshape(x,y) method,
where x are rows and y are columns

n.reshape(3,9)

This one is not an IN PLACE method

To convert an existing list into an ndarray we use the asarray(x) method
where x is the list

numpy.asarray(x)

To work with images we have to install the OpenCV (Computer Vision) Library
pip install opencv-python
