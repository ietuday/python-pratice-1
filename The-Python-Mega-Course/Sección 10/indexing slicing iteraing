INDEXING
To access a certain columns/rows portion we use the following

im_g = [[187, 158, 104, 121, 143],
       [198, 125, 255, 255, 147],
       [209, 134, 255,  97, 182]]
Example: Access the following values: 104, 121
                                      255, 255
im_g[0:2,2:4]
The first parameter is the lists we want to access. We are accessing the first and
second list, the third one (2) is not included due this notation is upper bound
exclusive

The second parameter are the columns of the lists we sliced before
This is the result:
array([[104, 121],
       [255, 255]], dtype=uint8)

To access a single value we do as it is a matrix
im_g[1,2]
  255

ITERAING
for i in im_g:
  print (i)

This one will print all the lists but not the values

To print all the values we can do either of the following codes
for i in im_g:
  for j in i:
    print(j)

Or more simple

for i in im_g.flat:
  print(i)
